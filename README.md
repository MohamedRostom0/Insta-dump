# Insta-dump
A fusion of instagram & reddit where a user can;
- Create posts that must include an image, title, and description.
- View randomly chosen posts on the 'Home' page.
- Upvote or Downvote posts viewed on his/her timeline.

## Future possible features:
- Use Federated Learning to understand each user preferences, so that the users have a tailored timeline feed that they will like.
